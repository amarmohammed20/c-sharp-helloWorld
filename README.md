# c# Hello World With A Twist

Created a hello world app in c# to help my understand of the .net environment and c# lanuage. Currently use c# in my role as a software developer at [Travel Chapter](https://www.travelchapter.com/). I quickly managed to create a hello world app so I decided to make the app somewhat interactive so asked for user input. 

## What Does This App Do
The app create a console game that gets the user to guess a number and than confirms if that number is correct

## Purpose Of The App
To get me started of in understanding the c# lanugae and the .net environment

## Take Aways
The take away was that the fundementals was very similiar to Javascript and also helped me see why Typescript is around and what it is trying to acheive.
